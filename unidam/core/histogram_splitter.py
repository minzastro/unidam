    Function to split histogram using local minima and local maxima.

    We detect local minima and maxima of the histogram.
    Local minima (or maxima) are defined as locations of bins that have
    lower (higher) value $h_i$ than all other bins within the window:
    $h_i = min\{h_j, i-n \leq j \leq i+n\}$ for a local minimum and
    $h_i = max\{h_j, i-n \leq j \leq i+n\}$ for a local maximum.
    Window size $n$ was taken to be 3 for maxima and 2 for minima.
    Differences in window sizes are caused by the need to locate minima with
    high precision and to avoid too many maxima in noisy data.
    Formally, it is possible to have more than one local minimum between
    two local maxima -- we split only by the lowest of them in this case.
    We split the sample at positions of local minima that are lower
    than 0.75 times the value of the smallest of the two enclosing maxima.
